                                Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python program implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

Playing the Game
Run the program.
Enter your choice:
'r' for rock
'p' for paper
's' for scissors
'q' to quit the game
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The result of the game will be displayed: whether it's a tie, a win for the player, or a loss.
The game will continue until the user decides to quit or wins.

Notes:
If the user enters 'q' at any point, the game will exit.
The game continues in a loop until the user decides to quit or achieves victory.
