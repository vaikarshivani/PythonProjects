# Mad Libs Generator

This Python program generates a Mad Libs story based on user input. Mad Libs is a word game where players fill in the blanks of a story with different types of words (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives) without knowing the full context. The result is often humorous and unexpected.

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the `madlibs.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to enter different words such as an adjective, verbs, and the name of a famous person.
3. The program will use your inputs to create a customized Mad Libs story.
4. The final story will be displayed, incorporating the words you provided.

## Examples Program

youtuber = "AmazingChannel"
print("subscribe to" + youtuber)
print("subscribe to {}".format(youtuber))
print(f"subscribe to {youtuber}")
